Technologies:

    - github (actions, pages, issues)
    - alpinejs, tailwind (reactive js, simplified css, standard html)

Data is periodically generated by github actions and saved in github issues.

[docs/index.html (aka github pages) is used to view the data](https://markfirmware.github.io/test33)

This approach eliminates the need for the browser to require any authorization.
